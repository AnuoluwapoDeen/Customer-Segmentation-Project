This project aimed to help Sticker improve its customer retention rate by nine percentage points, from 88% to 97%. The organization is a software company that provides various solutions to help businesses manage their operations. Despite having a high retention rate, the organization was concerned about the current economic climate and the potential risk of losing customers with a big budget. To tackle this challenge, I was tasked with analyzing the current customer data, grouping them according to their industry, segmented them into four quadrants (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze subscribers) based on annual revenue and subscription value.
This will help Sticker develop a communication plan to guide customer success and identify expansion targets and churn risks. Also, help marketing to identify the company's best and least performing industry to channel its marketing campaigns accordingly. The project objective was to provide Sticker with a comprehensive plan to improve customer retention, ensure its customers remain happy and loyal and improve marketing campaign efforts.

For this project, I analyzed subscriber data using PostgreSQL. Here is the database schema:

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Many companies struggle with customer retention, which can be costly. Sticker currently has a retention rate of 88%, but with the current economic state and the fear of losing customers with a big budget, they want to increase it to 97%. They must identify expansion targets and churn risks and develop a communication plan to guide customer success to achieve this. The challenge is to manage customers with a high subscription value but a low budget and understand the potential risk of nonprofits that work business to consumers. The problem statement is to find a way to improve customer retention and develop a communication plan to help Sticker keep its customers happy and loyal while improving the marketing campaign to generate more new business.

KEY FINDINGS

After analyzing the data, I have discovered the following insights:

1. The Combo bundle was popular among the industry buyers.
2. The Apps product was purchased as a single product by the industry.
3. The majority of subscribers were Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze members.
4. The number of subscriptions purchased per year varied across different industries.
5. The smallest and largest deal sizes, the product purchased, the subscriber's industry, and the year of subscription purchase were identified.
6. The year with the highest number of subscriptions sold was determined.
7. The total amount of subscriptions sold per year and for the entire view period was calculated.
Using this information, the organization can rate customer satisfaction and identify areas where customer success and engagement can be improved to aviod churn risk. Additionally, a communication plan can be developed to improve customer retention. Moreover, expansion targets can be identified to increase revenue and customer base.

RECOMMEDATIONS

Invest in promoting Apps product: From the findings, it is obivous apps is the company's highest selling solution, so the organization should consider investing in marketing and promoting the Apps product to increase sales and reach more customers.
Analyze subscription purchase patterns across industries: Understanding the subscription purchase patterns across different industries can help the organization tailor its marketing and sales strategies accordingly. For example, if one industry tends to purchase more subscriptions during a particular time of year, the organization can plan promotions or sales during that time to capitalize on that trend.
Improve customer engagement: In addition to analyzing purchase patterns, the organization should also focus on improving customer engagement. This can be done through targeted email campaigns, social media engagement, and personalized product recommendations based on past purchases.
